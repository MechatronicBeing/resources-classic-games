- **Title** : "p4wn, a smallish javascript chess engine"
- **Description**
  > "P4wn is both - an online web page and an offline HTML mobile and tablet application - that can play chess.  It is quite small, plays well enough to be interesting, and is easy to embed in your pages. The default interface is easy to replace, and the engine is simple and tunable."
